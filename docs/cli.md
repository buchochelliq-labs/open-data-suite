# `ods` command-line reference

`ods` is one binary with a subcommand per module. This page covers what every
command shares. Design rationale is in [ADR-0003](adr/0003-cli-presentation-boundary.md)
(output) and [ADR-0004](adr/0004-cli-framework-and-exit-codes.md) (framework, exit
codes).

## Commands

| Command | Status |
|---|---|
| `ods state` | planned: M1 State MVP (v0.1.0) |
| `ods erd` | planned: M3 ERD & Usage (v0.3.0) |
| `ods usage` | planned: M3 ERD & Usage (v0.3.0) |
| `ods ci` | planned: M4 ODS CI (v0.4.0) |
| `ods lsp` | planned: M5 LSP & VS Code (v0.5.0) |
| `ods agent` | planned: M6 ODS Agent (v0.6.0) |
| `ods version` | available |
| `ods completions <shell>` | available |

Planned commands already appear in `--help`. They accept any arguments and exit with
status 3.

## Global flags

These work before or after the subcommand (`ods --json version` and
`ods version --json` are the same).

| Flag | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output` | `human`, `plain`, `json` | `human` when stdout is a terminal, otherwise `plain` |
| `--json` | shorthand for `--output json` | |
| `--color` | `auto`, `always`, `never` | `auto` |
| `--width` | columns (≥ 20) | terminal width, or 100 when not a terminal |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | repeatable: `-v` info, `-vv` debug, `-vvv` trace | warnings only |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | errors only; conflicts with `-v` | |
| `-h`, `--help` / `-V`, `--version` | | |

## Output and streams

- **stdout** carries results only: styled (`human`), line-oriented (`plain`), or one
  JSON document (`json`).
- **stderr** carries logs, progress and, outside JSON mode, error messages.
- In **JSON mode**, stdout always receives exactly one document, even when the command
  fails:

```json
{
  "schema_version": {"major": 0, "minor": 1},
  "command": "state",
  "ods_version": "0.1.0",
  "result": null,
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "level": "error",
      "code": "ODS-E0003",
      "message": "`ods state` is not implemented yet",
      "hint": "planned for M1 State MVP (v0.1.0); see docs/ROADMAP.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

`result` is the command's result model on success and `null` on failure. `hint` is
omitted when there is none. The one exception is usage errors (bad flags or an unknown
command), which are detected before the output mode is known. They are always printed
as text on stderr.

## Exit status

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | success | The command did what was asked, including when stdout closes early (`ods … \| head`). |
| 1 | failure | The command could not complete: I/O, provider or internal error. |
| 2 | usage | Invalid arguments or flags. |
| 3 | not implemented | The command is planned but not available yet. |
| 4 | config | Configuration is invalid, including an unknown `ODS_LOG` value. |
| 5 | check failed | The command ran and its verdict is negative, e.g. a CI gate found blocking issues. |

The output mode never changes the exit status. These codes are a stable contract: new
meanings get new numbers.

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ODS-E0001` | Writing command output failed. |
| `ODS-E0002` | Unexpected internal error. Please report it. |
| `ODS-E0003` | The command is planned but not implemented yet. |
| `ODS-E0004` | `ODS_LOG` holds an unknown log level. |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ODS_LOG` | Log level: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace`. Overrides `-v`/`-q`. |
| `NO_COLOR` | Any non-empty value disables colour when `--color auto`. `--color always` overrides it. |
| `TERM` | `dumb` or `unknown` disables colour when `--color auto`. |

## Shell completion

`ods completions <shell>` prints a completion script for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`,
`powershell` or `elvish`. The script is generated from the commands in the binary, so it
always matches your version.

```bash
# bash
ods completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/ods
# zsh (a directory on your $fpath)
ods completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_ods
# fish
ods completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/ods.fish
# PowerShell (add to your profile)
ods completions powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Configuration

Project, user and profile configuration is tracked in #7. When it lands, it will be
loaded once and given to every command in the same way. Configuration errors will use
exit status 4.
